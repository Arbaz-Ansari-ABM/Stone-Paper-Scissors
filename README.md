# Stone-Paper-Scissors
Stone, Paper, Scissors is a classic hand game where each of the three possible moves—rock, paper, or scissors—beats one and loses to another. Rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. Players choose one move each, and the winner is determined based on these rules. It's often used to make quick decisions or resolve disputes.
